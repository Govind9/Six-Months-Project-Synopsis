\section{The C Programming Language}
C is the language of the Linux kernel. Almost all of the kernel and related applications are written in C. C is of course the language of development in this project.\\
C is a general-purpose programming language with features economy of expression, modern flow control and data structures, and a rich set of operators. C is not a ``very high level'' language, nor a ``big''one, and is not specialized to any particular area of application. But its absence of restrictions and its generality make it more convenient and effective for many tasks than supposedly more powerful languages. C was originally designed for and implemented on the UNIX operating system on the DEC PDP-11, by Dennis Ritchie. The operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX applications programs (including all of the software used to prepare this book) are written in C. Production compilers also exist for several other machines, including the IBM System/370, the Honeywell 6000, and the Interdata 8/32. C is not tied to any particular hardware or system, however, and it is easy to write programs that will run without change on any machine that supports C.\\
The C language has a very simple structure and hence is much easily converted into machine code without any overhead that may be faced when using other languages. That is why almost all of the kernel development and device drivers are done in C language only even after the introduction of so many other versatile languages like C++.
