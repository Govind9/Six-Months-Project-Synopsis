\section{Existing Systems}
Bluetooth has been a prominent technology in networking and has been the backbone of many user applications. As such it only makes sense that an operating system incorporates enough attention to Bluetooth as a technology. And this is exactly the case with Linux. It was realized early on that Bluetooth is going to be a major player and hence efforts were made to have it be an integral part of Linux. The software side of Bluetooth is official Bluetooth protocol stack for Linux which will be looked at in later sections of this report. The other major thing that then remains is the hardware: the Bluetooth adapter. In the modern computers mostly the Bluetooth adapter is inbuilt in the computer hardware itself but even if a Bluetooth adapter is not inbuilt into the system, there are a plethora of very inexpensive Bluetooth adapters in the market that can be used as plug and play peripheral to get Bluetooth working. This is of course possible because Linux, the OS has a stack support for Bluetooth, so once a hardware is detected then all that remains is to bridge this stack to the device using some standard protocol. All of this is taken care by the device driver for that particular device. It is simple, in order for a device to be supported, there has to be a device driver for it, and in this section I describe some of the widely used Bluetooth adapters that are supported by Linux at the time this writing:
\subsection{BlueFritz USB Bluetooth adapter}
The Bluetooth-Stick BlueFRITZ! USB allows you cordless connects to various Bluetooth devices. These can be, for example, access points for DSL or ISDN. It is very apt to connect to printers, mobile phones and PDAs. This allows better mobility, high speed, faster connection set-up and optimal line quality and maximum operational safety.

\subsection{Qualcomm Atheros chips}
Qualcomm Atheros is a developer of  semiconductors  for  network  communications, particularly wireless chipsets. Qualcomm Atheros offers Bluetooth chips for a variety of platforms. The company also offers integrated combo WLAN and Bluetooth chips. In July 2008, Atheros released an open-source Linux driver for their 802.11n devices which includes its Bluetooth chipset as well.

Qualcomm Atheros’ Bluetooth solution is the AR3001 family of chipsets. The Qualcomm AR3001 is a highly integrated, all-CMOS, single-chip Bluetooth 2.1 and 3.0 + HS solution for mobile handset and portable electronics applications. The compact size and low power consumption of this AR3001 design make it an ideal vehicle for adding Bluetooth to hand-held and other battery-powered consumer electronic devices. The AR3001 supports the standard UART HCI interface and is therefore compatible with any upper layer Bluetooth stack. It is also designed to require less than 12 passive components, thus providing the lowest system BOM cost for mobile phone or portable consumer electronics applications. The AR3001 supports advanced architecture and protocol techniques to save power during sleep, stand-by and active states. The AR3001 family supports 2-, 3- and 4-wire Bluetooth coexistence protocols with advanced algorithms for predicting channel usage by the co-located WLAN transceiver in the same system. It supports all Bluez profiles. 
\subsection{Intel Bluetooth Devices}
Intel is a leading supplier of Bluetooth solutions, offering a product portfolio from mobile phones to automotive, industrial, and medical applications. Linux has drivers for Bluetooth devices offered by Intel.\\
They offer single-chip semiconductor solutions as well as system modules and integrated IP-block solutions to enable increased flexibility and optimization.\\
The Intel BlueMoon architecture is now in its sixth generation and offers a well-proven functionality and performance. Intel BlueMoon products offer superior RF performance along with innovative software solutions for high quality operation. The Intel BlueMoon product family has been designed for voice quality and high-performance data transmissions with reduced requirements on the host processor.\\
Their single solutions are small and cost-effective, targeting mobile phones, automotive, industrial, and medical applications. Intel’s module solutions are Bluetooth qualified, offering an accelerated time to market and lower initial investments.\\
Intel is one of the seven promoters of the Bluetooth SIG and has participated in Bluetooth standardization since the start of Bluetooth.

\subsection{Broadcom Blutonium}
The Blutonium BCM2045 is the primary single-chip solution for Bluetooth applications, designed from the ground up to promote and enable the adoption of Bluetooth in phones, computers, peripherals and other devices. The chip exhibits stellar features like low power consumption, board space, radio performance and low cost. The chip supports the new Bluetooth Extended Data Rate (EDR), providing raw bandwidth of 3 Megabits per second for wireless applications. In addition, Broadcom’s inConcert interference avoidance technology reduces possible disruption from nearby Wi-Fi products, which operate in the same 2.4 GHz radio frequency as Bluetooth.

\subsection{Marvell Bluetooth}
88W8689 constitutes Marvell’s family of Bluetooth solutions among other solutions as well. With the addition of 88W8689, Marvell now provides a comprehensive set of Bluetooth 2.0-enabled products that target high-volume consumer markets. The highly integrated chip is optimized for both voice and audio transmissions, enabling an array of ultra-mobile, low-power consumer devices. \\
There are other solutions by Marvell for Bluetooth as well and they work well with Linux as the driver is there for them.

\subsection{3Com Bluetooth PCMCIA Card}
The 3Com Wireless Bluetooth PC Card is a Bluetooth version 1.1 device, but 3Com refers it as Version 2.0. Two applications are included: 3Com Bluetooth Mobile Connection Manager, for mobile communications configuration outside the Bluetooth network, and 3Com Bluetooth Connection Manager. The 3Com PC Card adapter provides a well-designed and easy-to-use solution with the antenna retracted, the device sits flush with the edge of your notebook’s Type II PC Card slot, making it easy to transport. You can even leave the PC Card in your notebook permanently so that you’re always prepared to connect with other Bluetooth-enabled devices. While leaving the 3Com card in your computer will cause minimal battery drain, you can always disable the adapter by ejecting it.\\
The PC Card is easy to install and has support in Linux kernel as well.
