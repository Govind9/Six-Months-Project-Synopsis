\noindent Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard for exchanging data over short distances. While exchanging data is the most accurate and popular use case of Bluetooth, the technology has transcended this simple initial purpose. Bluetooth is managed by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG), which has more than 25, 000 member companies in the areas of telecommunication, computing, networking and consumer electronics. Bluetooth technology has found itself to be a perfect fit for many and many short distance communication problems, and has also re invented and improved itself over the years in order to keep up with the market trends. One such monumental change or addition to Bluetooth that is going to feature heavily in this report is Bluetooth Low Energy, a smarter and edgier version of Bluetooth.\\

\noindent Linux, a Unix-like and mostly POSIX-compliant, open souce OS kernel is also the most used kernel in operating systems varying from PCs, mobiles, SoCs, etc.\\

\noindent This project report documents in detail the integration of BlueNRG, A Bluetooth network processor by STMicroelectronics with the Linux kernel. A detailed account is presented of the study of Bluetooth Low Energy protocol stack, Linux device model, and all other things that contributed to the final product i.e. a Linux device driver for BlueNRG.
