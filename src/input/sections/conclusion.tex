\section{Conclusion}
I have learnt a great deal working on this project. The learning was not limited to project only but the whole experience of working as an intern in a multinational company like STMicroelectronics was immensely educational. Being an intern, one is always challenged by the fundamental difference between classroom coaching and real industrial experience. But such a challenge is exactly the purpose of six months training.\\
The whole experience of working on this project and contributing in a few others has been very rewarding as it has given great opportunities to learn new things and get a firmer grasp on already known technologies. Here is a reiteration of some of the technologies I have encountered, browsed and learnt:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Operating System: \textbf{Linux}
	\item Language: \textbf{C}
	\item Development Host: \textbf{Raspberry Pi}, \textbf{BeagleBone Black}
	\item Integrated Build Environment: \textbf{Buildroot}
\end{itemize}
So during this project I learnt all the above things. Above all I got to know how software is developed and how much work and attention to details is required in building even the most basic of components of any project. Planning, designing, developing code, working in a team, testing, etc. these are all very precious lessons in themselves.
