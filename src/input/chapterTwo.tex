BlueNRG is a very low power Bluetooth low energy (BLE) single-mode network processor, compliant with Bluetooth specification v4.0. It has an embedded Bluetooth low energy protocol stack: GAP, GATT, SM, L2CAP, LL, RF-PHY. It can play both master and slave roles communicating with other devices or PCs using a proprietary Application Controller Interface (ACI) in addition to the standard Host Controller Interface (HCI) via SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface).
